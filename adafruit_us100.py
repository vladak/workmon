        object in front of the sensor is too close, the wiring is incorrect or the
        sensor is not found. If the signal received is not 2 bytes, return ``None``.
        This means either the sensor was moving too fast to be pointing in the right
        direction to pick up the ultrasonic signal when it bounced back (less
        likely), or the object off of which the signal bounced is too far away
        for the sensor to handle. In my experience, the sensor can not detect
        objects over 460 cm away.
